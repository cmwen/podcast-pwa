### Execution Agent Workflow

This project follows an **Execution Agent** development approach with strict traceability between Product backlog â†’ Design â†’ Execution â†’ QA.

#### Development Principles

- **Confirm assumptions first** - Always validate design decisions before implementation
- **Suggest alternatives** - Propose implementation options when requirements are ambiguous
- **Highlight risks** - Flag performance, scalability, or maintainability concerns
- **Test coverage** - Always provide test scaffolding alongside implementation

#### Commit Conventions

Use these tags for traceability:

- **[Execution â†’ QA]** - Implementation ready for QA testing
- **[Design â†’ Execution]** - Implementation of specific design decision
- **[Backlog â†’ Execution]** - Implementation of backlog item
- **[Technical Debt]** - Refactoring or improvement work

#### Documentation Requirements

1. **Update `/docs/execution_log.md`** for each feature implemented
2. **Link to design decisions** in `/docs/design.md`
3. **Reference backlog items** from `/docs/vision.md`
4. **Include test suggestions** following `/docs/test_scaffolding.md`

#### Implementation Standards

- Mobile-first responsive design
- PWA compliance (offline-capable, installable)
- Performance budget: <1.5s load time, <50KB app shell
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### Quality Assurance

The project maintains high quality standards through:

- **Automated testing** - Unit tests (Vitest) + E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Performance monitoring** - Lighthouse CI with performance budgets
- **Code quality** - ESLint + Prettier with strict TypeScript
- **PWA compliance** - Automated PWA validation in CI pipeline

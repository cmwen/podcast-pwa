# Execution Log — Podcast PWA

## Execution Agent Framework

This document maintains traceability between **Product backlog items**, **Design decisions**, and **Execution implementation** with suggested test coverage.

---

## Execution Workflow

### Commit Tagging Convention

- **[Execution → QA]** - Implementation ready for QA testing
- **[Design → Execution]** - Implementation of design decision
- **[Backlog → Execution]** - Implementation of backlog item
- **[Technical Debt]** - Refactoring or improvement work

### Implementation Principles

1. **Confirm assumptions first** - Validate design decisions before implementation
2. **Suggest alternatives** - Propose implementation options when ambiguous
3. **Highlight risks** - Flag performance, scalability, maintainability concerns
4. **Test coverage** - Always propose test scaffolding alongside implementation

4. **Service Worker update conflicts** - Versioned SW with graceful updates

### Performance Targets

- **App initial load:** < 1.5s on mobile (3G network)
- **Critical path:** App Shell < 50KB
- **Storage allocation:** IndexedDB ~1-5MB, Cache API ~100MB
